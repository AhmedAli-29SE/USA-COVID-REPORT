# USA-COVID-REPORT
Power BI Dashboard
Objective:
The objective of the "USA COVID REPORT" project portfolio is to provide a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across the United States. This project aims to:
    Aggregate Data: Collect and integrate COVID-19 data from various reliable sources, including test positivity rates, total recovered progress, population, and Fatality rates.
    Analyze Trends: Perform in-depth analysis to identify patterns and trends over time, geographic regions, and demographic groups.
    Visualize Information: Create clear and interactive visualizations to help users understand the spread and control of COVID-19 across different states and counties.
    Enhance Accessibility: Ensure that the data and findings are accessible and understandable to a wide audience, including those without a technical background.
By achieving these goals, the "USA COVID REPORT" seeks to contribute to the broader effort of managing and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
Key Insights:
1. Case Trends: The total number of cases has been increasing steadily, with a significant spike in recent weeks.
2. Death Trends: The total number of deaths has also been increasing, but at a slower rate than cases.
3. Case Fatality Rate (CFR): The CFR has decreased over time, indicating improved treatment outcomes.
4. Mortality Rate: The mortality rate has decreased, indicating reduced severity of cases.
5. Recovery Rate: The recovery rate has increased, indicating improved treatment outcomes.
6. Testing Rate: The testing rate has increased, indicating improved detection and monitoring of cases.
By highlighting these key insights, the "USA COVID REPORT" aims to provide a holistic understanding of the pandemic's multifaceted impact and support efforts to improve public health outcomes.
Tool Used:
1. Power BI: A business analytics service by Microsoft that allows for data visualization, reporting, and analysis.
2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): A formula language used in Power BI to define calculations and measures.
3. SQL: A programming language used for managing and analyzing relational databases, used to extract and transform data for analysis.
4. Data modeling: A process used to create a conceptual representation of data, organizing data into tables, relationships, and hierarchies.
5. Data visualization: The process of creating graphical representations of data to better understand and communicate insights.
These tools enable data analysis, visualization, and reporting, providing insights into the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA.
